        <p class="my-6"><a href="https://circusforge.org">Circus Forge</a> is a community organization dedicated to furthering circus arts in the Philadelphia area.
    Our objective is to provide institutional backing to local artists and groups so they can pursue avenues that would otherwise be logistically or finanically out of reach. Our long term goal is to establish a phyiscal space where both circus professionals and dedicated hobbyists can learn, collaborate, and create together. 
    Circus Forge is a member-driven organization that values the interests of the entire circus community and strives to support all members in pursuit of their goals.</p>
